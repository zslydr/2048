# 2048

Genetic algorithm applied to neural networks to solve the 2048 game. The first results are disappointing.

Implementation of NEAT algorithm (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies), which fits better the context of genetic evolution applied to neural networks.

## Overview of the AI playing so far

Below is the first "decent" result obtained from the NEAT algorithm:
