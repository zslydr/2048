# 2048

Genetic algorithm applied to neural networks to solve the 2048 game. The first results are disappointing.

The next step is to develop a pygame interface to test the game properly, and then try to implement a NEAT algorithm (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies), which fits better the context of genetic evolution applied to neural networks.
